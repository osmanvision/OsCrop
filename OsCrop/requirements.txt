# ðŸ§ª Requirements for OsCrop

This file lists the Python packages required to run OsCrop tools.

If you're only using the background remover (`oscrop_bg_remover.py`), you only need:
```
rembg
```

If you're using the full pipeline (`oscrop_full.py`) or any of the crop tools, install all:
```
rembg
opencv-python
pillow
numpy
```

Install using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
